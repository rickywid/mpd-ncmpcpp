This is my configuration files for MPD and Ncmpcpp.

#### [Music Player Daemon (MPD)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon) 
A flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol.

#### [Ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ncmpcpp) 
Is an mpd client (compatible with mopidy) with a UI very similar to ncmpc, but it provides new useful features such as support for regular expressions for library searches, extended song format, items filtering, the ability to sort playlists, and a local filesystem browser.
